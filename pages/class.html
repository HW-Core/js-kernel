It's a full featured module that aims to port the class logic of other OOP 
languages to javascript.


<h3>Current supported features are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Abstract class: basic support to avoid instantiation</li>
    <li>Final class: you can't extend a final class or add members dynamically</li>
    <li>Base: it's the same of "extend" keyword of other langs
        your object inherits all methods of extended class and they shares
        prototype that allow you to cast the instanceof succesfully
    </li>
    <li>Use: it's the mechanism of traits used also by other languages to  
        horizontally extends other class. in few words: 
        you can use methods from other objects. 
        <subline>It's not fully implemented yet, if you have some issues please
        report 
        </subline>
    </li>
    <li>Private members</li>
    <li>Public members</li>
    <li>Static members</li>

</ul>
